Clone detector evaluation experiments can be conducted using the commands in
`commands/`.  These commands should be executed from within their directory.

================================================================================

The following is the role of each command.  The commands can be executed as
./commandName from within the 'commands/' directory.  They will then guide you
through their required inputs.

|| listTools || - Lists the tools currently tracked by the database.
           Input: None.
	  Output: The tools, their IDs, names and descriptions.


|| addTool || - Adds a new tool to the database.
         Input: A name and description for the tool.
        Output: The ID of the tool in the database.


|| deleteTool || - Removes a tool from the database, as well as its imported
                   clones.
            Input: The ID of the clone to delete.
           Output: The number of imported clones removed.


|| importClones || - Imports detected clones into the database.
	    Input: The ID of the tool that detected these clones, and the file
                   containing the clones.
           Output: The number of clones imported.

|| countClones || - Counts the number of detected clones imported for a tool.
             Input: The ID of the tool.
            Ouptut: The number of detected clones imported for this tool.

|| evaluateTool || - Evaluates the recall of a tool based on its imported
                     clones.
              Input: The ID of the tool, the file to output the results to, the
                     clones to evaluate recall for, and the clone matcher
                     configuration. (Described in the next section).
	     Output: The results to the specified file.

================================================================================

Clone file for inportClones should contain one clone pair per line in the
following format:

"directory,filename,startline,endline,directory,filename,startline,endline"

Where the first four and last four elements are the two code fragments that form
the clone pair.  Directory is one of 'default','selected' and 'sample' from
IJaDataset, filename is the file within that directory, and startline/endline
are the start and end of the code fragment.

For example:
sample,BinarySearch.java,10,20,default,102456.java,20,30
selected,10563.java,15,24,default,15312,java,30,45

================================================================================

The 'evaluateTool' command will ask for a number of evaluation parameters.

  Basic
  -----
            ID - The ID of the tool to measure recall for.
    ResultFile - The file (path) to output the results to (file should not
                  already exist).


  Clone Size
  ----------
These configurations define the minimum and maximium size of the clones recall
is measured for.  Clone size is measured as the minimum/maximum size of a clone
pair's code fragments.  All of these constraints are optional.

           Min. Lines - Minimum clone size in original code lines.
           Max. Lines - Maximum clone size in original code lines.
          Min. Tokens - Minimum clone size in tokens.
          Max. Tokens - Maximum clone size in tokens.
    Min. Pretty Lines - Minimum clone size in pretty-printed lines.
    Max. Pretty Lines - Maximum clone size in pretty-printed lines.

Historically, clone-benchmarking experiments have used a 6-line minimum.
However, this is rather small, and some clone detectors may have poor precision
at this clone size.  Most modern Type-3 clone detection tools reccomend a
minimum clone size of 10-15 lines.


  Clone Similarity Type
  ---------------------
This defines how clone similarity is measured when measuring recall for
different regions of syntactical similarity.  Each reference clone in the
benchmark has syntactical similarity measured by pretty-printed line (approx.
per statement) and by token after Type-1 (pretty-printing) and Type-2
(identifier and literal abstraction) normalizations.

Clone similarity type is one of the following:

    Token - The by-token clone similarity is used.
     Line - The by-line clone similarity is used.
      Avg - The average of the by-token and by-line clone similarity is used.
     Both - The smaller of the by-line and by-token clone similarity is used.

We reccomend using 'both'.  It is the most conservative choice.


  Clone Matcher
  -------------
The benchmark uses a coverage-based clone matching algorithm.  A reference
clone is considered detected by a tool if the tool reported a detected clone
that covers a minimum ratio of the reference clone.  Optionally, the matcher
can be configured to also require the reference clone to cover a certain ratio
of the detected clone (to ensure the reference clone is a significant aspect
of the detected clone).  Formally it has the following:

    Coverage Ratio - The ratio of the reference clone that must be covered.
    Featured Ratio - The minimum ratio of the detected clone that the reference 
                     clone must cover for the detected clone to be considered a
                     match (in addition to the coverage ratio). (Optional).

We reccomend using a coverage ratio of 70% and no featured ratio.  This gives
benefit to the tools in the evaluation.  70% is standard in benchmarking
experiments.


  Minimum Clone Similarity
  ------------------------
The benchmark will evaluate recall for different regions of clone syntactical
similarity.  This is the minimum clone similarity to measure recall down to.
Measuring recall for the entire spectrum can be very time consuming, especially
since most tools do not detect semantic clones with low syntactical similarity.

We reccomend using a minimum clone similarity of 50%.  This won't take too long
to run the evaluation, and most tools wouldn't have any recall for clones with
less than 50% sytnactical similarity.
